# Technical Clarity for Non-Technical Founders

Choose the right technical path — before costly mistakes are made

---

## Who This Is For

You’re building a B2C SaaS product and need to make early technical decisions, but don’t want to guess, overbuild, or waste time and money fixing avoidable mistakes later.

The right support depends on where you are today. Choose the engagement that matches your current stage.

## Choose Your Path

---

### MVP Tech Blueprint
*For founders before building or hiring*

**Price:** $4,000  
**Timeline:** 1–2 weeks  
**Format:** Fixed-scope engagement

**What it is**  
A focused engagement that gives you a clear, opinionated technical plan before you write code or hire engineers.

**Best if you:**
- Have an idea but no production code
- Are unsure which tech stack makes sense
- Are about to hire your first engineer
- Want confidence before spending real money

**Outcome**  
You leave knowing exactly what to build first, what technology to use and why, what tradeoffs you’re accepting, and how to move forward without guessing or rebuilding later.

---

### Founder Tech Audit
*For founders with an existing MVP or codebase*

**Price:** $2,500  
**Timeline:** 1 week  
**Format:** Fixed-scope review

**What it is**  
A focused technical audit of your existing product to identify risks, misalignments, and decision gaps before you invest further.

**Best if you:**
- Already have an MVP or live product
- Suspect early technical decisions may be limiting you
- Are seeing performance, velocity, or maintainability issues
- Want a second opinion before scaling or fundraising

**Outcome**  
You gain clarity on what’s working, what’s risky, what can stay as-is, and what decisions need to be revisited — without committing to a rebuild.

### Fractional CTO – Light
*For founders who need ongoing technical decision support*

**Price:** $3,000 / month  
**Availability:** Limited  
**Format:** Ongoing advisory support

**What it is**  
Lightweight, high-level technical leadership to support product, hiring, and architecture decisions — without bringing on a full-time CTO.

**Best if you:**
- Already have technical clarity
- Are actively building or hiring
- Need a trusted decision partner, not a builder
- Want to avoid costly missteps as you scale

**Outcome**  
You get consistent, experienced guidance so technical decisions don’t slow progress or create long-term problems.
