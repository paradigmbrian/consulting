# Step 1: Ideal Client Profile (ICP)

**Do not answer with theory. Answer with the _actual people you want to work with_.**

### **1️⃣ The founder**

- **Are they technical or non-technical?  
    **
- **First-time founder or repeat?  
    **
- **Solo or co-founder team?  
    **

**(You can say "mostly non-technical first-time founders" if that's true.)**

### **2️⃣ The product**

**Pick one primary category (you can expand later):**

- **B2B SaaS  
    **
- **B2C app  
    **
- **Internal tools  
    **
- **Marketplace  
    **
- **API / platform  
    **

**Which one do you most want to specialize in _first_?**

### **3️⃣ The moment of pain**

**Which moment do you want to catch them in?**

**Examples:**

- **"We have an idea but no code"  
    **
- **"We hired a dev and things feel wrong"  
    **
- **"We need to move fast before fundraising"  
    **
- **"Our MVP works but feels fragile"  
    **

**Pick one that you want to anchor Phase 1 around.**

### **4️⃣ The consequence they fear**

**Founders buy when they're scared of a specific outcome.**

**Which scares them more?**

- **Wasting time  
    **
- **Wasting money  
    **
- **Looking incompetent to investors  
    **
- **Being unable to hire later  
    **
- **Having to rebuild  
    **

**Rank the top two.**

### **5️⃣ Your unfair advantage**

**This is _not_ "I'm experienced."**

**What do founders trust you with?**

- **Explaining tradeoffs simply  
    **
- **Saying "don't build this"  
    **
- **Fixing other people's bad decisions  
    **
- **Seeing around corners early  
    **

**Pick the one that feels most true.**

### **How to answer**

**Reply with short, direct bullets. No explanations yet.**

**Once we lock this, I'll:**

- **rewrite your ICP in tight language  
    **
- **pressure-test it for market pull  
    **
- **then we'll move to Step 2: the core offer and tighten it until it's undeniably valuable.  
    **

**Answers:**

- **Mostly non-technical first-time founders with no preference to solo or co-founder team.**
- **B2C SaaS**
- **We have an idea but no code**
- **Wasting time and money**
- **Explaining tradeoffs simply**

**ICP: Non-technical, first-time founders building a B2C SaaS product who have a validated idea but no production code, and are at the point where they need to choose a tech stack or hire their first engineer-while fearing that the wrong early technical decisions will force them to rebuild, overspend, or stall their startup.**

**Elevator Pitch: "I work with non-technical, first-time founders building B2C SaaS products who haven't written production code yet and are at the point where they need to decide what tech to use or who to hire-without wasting time or money rebuilding later."**

# Step 2: Define One Core Offer

## **Pushbacks You Will Get - and How to Respond**

### **Pushback 1: "Can't we just start building and adjust later?"**

**What they're really saying:**

**"I don't know which mistakes are expensive vs cheap."**

**Your response:**

**"Some mistakes are easy to fix later, and some aren't. Early technical decisions tend to be the expensive ones - especially around stack and architecture. This helps you know where you can move fast and where you should slow down."**

**Calm. Matter-of-fact. No scare tactics.**

### **Pushback 2: "Can't we just ask a developer or friend?"**

**What they're really saying:**

**"I don't know how to judge advice."**

**Your response:**

**"You can, and many founders do. The issue is that most developers give advice based on what they like or what they've used before. My role is to look at your specific situation, constraints, and goals and give you a recommendation I'd be comfortable standing behind."**

**You're not attacking friends - you're reframing accountability.**

### **Pushback 3: "Why not just hire someone and let them decide?"**

**What they're really saying:**

**"I don't know how to hire yet."**

**Your response:**

**"That works if you already know how to evaluate engineers and architecture decisions. Most first-time, non-technical founders don't. This gives you a clear plan so you can hire with confidence instead of outsourcing the decision blindly."**

**This positions you as a pre-hire safeguard.**

### **Pushback 4: "Isn't this something we could figure out ourselves?"**

**What they're really saying:**

**"I'm weighing cost vs confidence."**

**Your response:**

**"You probably could, given enough time and trial and error. The question is whether you want to spend that time learning what doesn't work, or start with clarity and focus your energy on building and validating the product."**

**No ego. No superiority.**

### **Pushback 5: "What do we actually get at the end?"**

**What they're really asking:**

**"Is this tangible?"**

**Your response:**

**"You'll walk away with a clear technical plan: what to build first, the recommended tech stack, why those choices make sense, the tradeoffs you're making, and a hiring roadmap if you need one. The goal is that you feel confident moving forward without second-guessing every decision."**

**Confidence is the deliverable.**

### **Pushback 6: "What if we want you to help us build afterward?"**

**What they're really saying:**

**"Will you abandon us?"**

**Your response:**

**"This engagement is intentionally focused on decisions, not implementation. Once the plan is clear, you'll be in a much better position to decide who should build - whether that's someone you hire, a team you work with, or something else."**

**You don't say "no." You say "not part of this."**

## **One Final Coaching Note (Important)**

**When you answer pushback:**

- **Slow down  
    **
- **Lower your voice  
    **
- **Don't over-explain  
    **

**If you talk too much, you sound unsure.**

**Silence after your response is a feature.**

# Step 3: Positioning Statement

## **Recommended Positioning Statement (Primary)**

This is the one I want you to **memorize and use**:

**"I help non-technical, first-time founders make the right early technology decisions so they don't waste time and money rebuilding or hiring the wrong engineers."**

### **Why this works**

- Clear "who" (filters hard)
    
- Decision-focused (not implementation)
    
- Names _real consequences  
    _
    
- No jargon, no buzzwords
    

If someone doesn't immediately get this, they're not your ICP.

## **Alternate Versions (Use Sparingly)**

### **Slightly Shorter (Casual Conversation)**

"I help non-technical founders avoid bad early tech decisions."

Only use this informally. It's incomplete but conversational.

### **Slightly More Specific (High-Stakes Conversations)**

"I help first-time, non-technical founders choose the right technology for their product before they build or hire, so they don't waste months rebuilding later."

This version emphasizes _timing_.

## **How to Use This Statement (Very Important)**

### **Where it belongs**

- At the top of your own notes
    
- In your head before every call
    
- As a filter when opportunities come in
    

### **Where it does not belong (yet)**

- Website hero copy
    
- LinkedIn headline
    
- Sales pages
    

# Step 4: Define Clear Boundaries

### **The mindset shift**

Boundaries are not restrictions.

They are **signals of professionalism and confidence**.

Founders trust people who say "no" cleanly.

## **Your Core Boundaries (Locked Set)**

These are **non-negotiable** unless the business _earns_ the right to change them later.

### **1. I do not work hourly**

**Why:** Hourly work makes you a pair of hands, not a decision-maker.

**If asked:**

"I don't work hourly because the value here is clarity and outcomes, not time spent."

Short. Neutral. End of discussion.

### **2. I do not start engagements with implementation**

**Why:** Building before decisions are clear destroys trust and leverage.

**If asked:**

"I intentionally separate decision-making from implementation so you're not paying to figure things out while building."

This frames it as client protection.

### **3. I do not underprice to 'build trust'**

**Why:** Cheap signals uncertainty and attracts founders who won't respect the process.

**If pushed on price:**

"If the cost doesn't make sense, that usually means the timing isn't right - and that's okay."

Say it slowly. Then stop.

### **4. I do not accept vague or open-ended scopes**

**Why:** Ambiguity is how scope creep and resentment start.

**If a founder is unclear:**

"If we can't define the decision we're trying to make, it's probably too early for this engagement."

This positions you as disciplined, not difficult.

### **5. I do not give away the Blueprint for free**

**Why:** Free advice trains founders to extract without committing.

**If someone wants "just a quick opinion":**

"I'm happy to talk at a high level, but detailed recommendations are part of the Blueprint so they're grounded in your full context."

This keeps conversations warm without leakage.

## **Where These Boundaries Show Up**

You don't announce them. You **embody** them:

- On founder calls
    
- In email follow-ups
    
- When someone tries to expand scope
    
- When you feel the urge to "be helpful"
    

Every time you violate one, you weaken the offer.

# Step 5: Founder Call Flow (Day 5)

### **The rule**

You are **not there to convince**.

You are there to **diagnose**.

If you diagnose well, the offer sells itself.

If you pitch, you lose authority.

## **The Founder Call Flow (Locked)**

This is a **sequence**, not a script. Don't memorize words-memorize intent.

### **1. "What are you building?"**

**Goal:** Understand the idea _at a high level_.

You're listening for:

- B2C vs B2B
    
- Complexity creep
    
- Whether the idea is real or still fantasy
    

If they ramble, let them. Rambling reveals confusion.

You do **not** correct them yet.

### **2. "What feels unclear or risky right now?"**

**Goal:** Surface anxiety.

This is the most important question in the call.

Listen for:

- "I'm not sure what stack makes sense"
    
- "I don't know who to hire first"
    
- "I'm worried we'll build the wrong thing"
    
- "Everyone gives different advice"
    

If they say "nothing," that's a red flag. Probe gently:

"If you had to guess, what would you be most worried about getting wrong?"

### **3. "What happens if those decisions are wrong?"**

**Goal:** Make the cost of guessing visible.

You are not scaring them.

You're helping them think clearly.

Let _them_ say things like:

- "We'd have to rebuild"
    
- "We'd burn runway"
    
- "We'd lose momentum"
    
- "We'd hire the wrong person"
    

Once they say it, **stop talking**. Silence does the work.

### **4. Introduce the MVP Tech Blueprint**

**Goal:** Position the offer as a response, not a pitch.

Use your locked Version A:

"Based on what you're describing, this is exactly the situation the MVP Tech Blueprint is designed for…"

Then explain **briefly**:

- 1-2 weeks
    
- Clear, opinionated recommendations
    
- Decisions before building or hiring
    
- Confidence instead of guessing
    

Do **not** justify price yet. Do **not** over-explain.

### **5. Pause and let them react**

**Goal:** See if there's pull.

Say nothing. Let the silence sit.

You're watching for:

- "That actually sounds helpful"
    
- "This is what we've been missing"
    
- "How does this work?"
    
- Or hesitation
    

If there's no pull, you don't force it.

## **If They Ask About Price**

Say it cleanly:

"The MVP Tech Blueprint is a fixed-scope engagement priced at $X."

Then stop talking.

Silence signals confidence.

## **If They're Not Ready**

You say:

"It might just be a timing thing. If you decide you want clarity before building or hiring, this will still be here."

This preserves trust and keeps the door open.

## **Your Role Summary (Burn This In)**

On founder calls:

- You diagnose
    
- You clarify
    
- You reflect risk back to them
    
- You offer a solution once
    

You do **not**:

- Chase
    
- Convince
    
- Discount
    
- Educate endlessly
