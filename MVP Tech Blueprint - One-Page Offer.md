## Clarity on What to Build and What to Build It With Before You Write Code

A short, fixed-scope engagement to help early founders avoid costly technical mistakes.

## Who This Is For

This is for you if:

- You're a first-time or non-technical founder

- You're building a B2C SaaS product

- You have a clear idea, but little or no code yet

- You're unsure which tech stack makes sense for your MVP

- You're worried about wasting months - or money - by making the wrong early decisions

This is not for teams who already have a full engineering team or are deep into implementation.

## The Problem

Most founders are forced to make critical technical decisions very early:

- What stack to use

- How much architecture is "enough" for an MVP

- Whether to hire, outsource, or wait

- What shortcuts are safe - and which ones aren't

These decisions are usually made with conflicting advice, strong opinions from engineers, and pressure to just start building. When those decisions are wrong, the cost shows up later as rebuilds, delays, or expensive hiring mistakes.

## The Outcome

After this engagement, you will have:

- A clear recommendation for what technology to use - and why

- Confidence that your MVP is simple without being fragile

- A realistic understanding of early tradeoffs

- A concrete plan for what to do next, without second-guessing

The goal is not perfection. The goal is reducing risk before momentum locks you in.

## What's Included

The MVP Tech Blueprint includes:

- A tailored technology stack recommendation

- Clear explanations of tradeoffs in plain language (cost, speed, scalability)

- MVP-appropriate architecture guidance

- A hiring roadmap that clarifies who to hire first and when

Everything is explained so you can make decisions confidently, even without a technical background.

## Timeline & Price

- Timeline: 1-2 weeks

- Format: Focused conversations plus a clear written summary

- Price: $4,000 (fixed scope, fixed price)

No hourly billing. No open-ended consulting. No implementation work.

## Next Step

If you're early and want clarity before committing serious time or money:
